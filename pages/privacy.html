            <p style="font-family: 'Inconsolata', monospace"> I've always loved puzzles, which is why I naturally gravitated towards problem solving and programming. My favorite work environment is one in which I'm given problems to solve, not solutions to code. When you're given just a problem, you're able to design a multitude of interesting ways to solve it, and many times that's when you come up with the best solutions.</p>

                    <p style="font-family: 'Inconsolata', monospace">"Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it." -Steve Jobs</p>
